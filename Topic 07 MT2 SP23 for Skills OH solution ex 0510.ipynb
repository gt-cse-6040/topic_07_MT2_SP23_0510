        "**Topics, number of exercises:** This problem builds on your knowledge of Numpy, pandas, database organization, graph abstractions, and basic Python (for interfacing with other Python libraries). It has **11** exercises, numbered 0 to **10**. There are **21** available points. However, to earn 100% the threshold is **12** points. (Therefore, once you hit **12** points, you can stop. There is no extra credit for exceeding this threshold.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Free points!** This exam includes one exercise, Exercise 3, whose points are \"**free**.\" However, to get these points you need to read some text and _submit the notebook to the autograder at least once_.\n",

        "**Exercise ordering:** Each exercise builds logically on previous exercises, but you may solve them in any order. Exercises are **not** necessarily ordered by difficulty, but higher point values usually imply more difficult tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Demo cells:** Code cells that start with the comment `### define demo inputs` will load results from prior exercises applied to the entire data set and use those to build demo inputs. These must be run for later demos to work properly but they do not affect the test cells. The data loaded by these cells may be large (at least in terms of human readability). You are free to inspect them, but we did not print them in the starter code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Debugging you code:** Right before each exercise test cell, there is a block of text explaining the variables available to you for debugging. You may use these to test your code and can print/display them as needed (careful when printing large objects, you may want to print the head or chunks of rows at a time).\n",

        "Darker bars correspond to more highly weighted components. You can see that the community genre-vectors are distinct from one another, albeit with some (expected) overlaps. Thus, there is, arguably, at least some additional evidence to suspect this initial grouping may be a meaningful one for helping users find other users and appropriate book recommendations. The analysis in this notebook operated on just a small fraction of the complete dataset, and it is possible that with more data more distinct communities could emerge."
